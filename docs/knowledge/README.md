# Knowledge

Richard Feynnman famously kept a list of "Things I don't know". This is my own list - a repository of personal knowledge that I update from time to time when I find interesting links or research a topic. These small changes are like compound interest. I only expect them to be useful and accurate after a lifetime of updates.

Use the sidebar to get started.
