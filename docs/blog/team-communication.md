# Team Communication (Draft)

Working on a team of more than 5 people usually means that you need to set up some sort of communication practice. How much is reasonable? How much communication is burdensome? What communication practices should you implement?

Open daily comms
-----

- this is the responsibility of everyone in the team.
- It is the minumum required comms, but anything more than this is above and beyond.

There are just too many methods out there for communicating - and people are never satisfied. You can't be all things to all people, so as a communicator you should focus on giving the mandatory amount (set by the company or your team), then anything more than that is as-hoc responsibility only. 

Two types of communication
---

- Questions with definite answers - what are you working on?
- Questions with made up answers - when will this be finished? Important to point out that any answer here *is* just going to be made up whether you want to admit it or not. If you ask these questions you are going to risk causing tension in the team. Why does it cause tension? Because if someone answers it then they are making a promise - their reputation is on the line.

The ignorant initiator
---
- It's impossible to keep everyone up to date *in the format that they want*. Because of this, companies should adopt the ignorant initiator.
- Person who wants some information should be responsible for seeking it out from the person who has that info
- The ignorant initiator should ask the question in an open forum (preferably a slack channel)
- The ignorant initiator should ask questions with definite answers, and can reasonably expect a response
- The ignorant initiator should ask questions without definite answers, but the person answering can give an open response
